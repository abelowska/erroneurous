This project aims to explain associations between biomarkers of error-related brain activity (ERN, Pe ERP components) and 15 different phenomena related to anxiety: 
- rumination; 
- overestimation of threat; 
- prospective and inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty; 
- behavioral inhibition; 
- mixed anxiety measured with STAI-T; 
- mixed anxiety measured with DASS-21; 
- OCD checking, ordering, obsessing, washing, and neutralizing symptoms; 
- OCD; 
- thought suppression;
- self-esteem. 

The project relies on PCA for spatial feature extraction and linear/nonlinear regression.


## Abstract

Changes in error processing are observable in a range of anxiety-related disorders. While elevated brain responses to errors (i.e., error-related negativity; ERN) characterize, for example, generalized anxiety disorder, various psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, show a blunted ERN. Numerous studies, however, have reported contradictory and non-replicating findings, thus the exact mapping of ERN to specific anxiety symptoms remains unclear. To reveal symptoms that are central for elevated ERN and error-related positivity (Pe), we obtained electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from 171 individuals while performing a speeded Go/No-Go task; also, we collected 16 self-reported scores of anxiety dimensions. Taking advantage of recent technological developments, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to deal with the complexity of the EEG data. We then used machine learning to (1) identify generalized ERN/Pe-anxiety dimension associations and to (2) show the low generalizability of traditional statistical approaches to event-related potential (ERP) analysis. ERN was significantly associated with rumination (R2 = 0.068), overestimation of threat (R2 = 0.055) and inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty (R2 = 0.036). Pe was associated with rumination (R2 = 0.063), prospective intolerance of uncertainty (R2 = 0.044) and behavioral inhibition (R2 = 0.023). The generalizability check results of the ERP analyses reveal the need for a change in result-validating methods in order to move toward robust findings that reflect stable individual differences and clinically useful biomarkers.


This project is part of the Error Monitoring Project, which aims to clarify the relationship and dynamics between error processing, individual differences and symptoms of psychopathology.
